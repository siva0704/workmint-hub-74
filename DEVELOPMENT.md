#### üèó Architecture Decisions

**Frontend Stack**
- React 18 + TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development experience
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- Zustand for lightweight state management
- React Query for server state and caching

- 48px minimum touch targets for mobile
- Consistent spacing and typography scale
- Card-based layouts for mobile optimization

**Component Organization**
- Feature-based folder structure
- Reusable UI components in `/components/ui/`
- Form components with validation in `/components/forms/`
- Layout components for consistent structure
- Page components in `/pages/` by role

#### üêõ Recent Fixes
